VerticaPy  is  a  Python  library  with   scikit-like
functionality  for conducting  data science  projects
on data stored in Vertica, taking advantage Vertica’s
speed and built-in  analytics  and  machine  learning
features. It supports  the entire  data  science life
cycle, uses a ‘pipeline’  mechanism to  sequentialize
data transformation  operations, and offers beautiful
graphical options.

VerticaPy aims  to do all  of the above.  The idea is
simple: instead of moving data around for processing, 
VerticaPy brings the logic to the data.
